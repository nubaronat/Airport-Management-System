# Airport-Management-System

The code of the Airport Management System is an efficiently organized, modular implementation designed for effective management of airport data. There is a clear structure because each module(airports, airlines, planes, routes, passengers, and flights) is contained in its own file. The system uses file handling and dynamic memory allocation to make data creation, storage, and retrieval easier. Users can easily navigate through functionalities, such as adding, removing, and viewing details of various entities, thanks to an intuitive text-based menu interface. While implementing basic input validation, the system prioritizes a straightforward user experience, making it a foundational tool for airport management tasks.
